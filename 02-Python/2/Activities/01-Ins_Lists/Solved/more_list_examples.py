# A list in Python is a collection of ordered elements or values, separated by commas, with an index of "zero" for the first element.

# Index: 0 = "green", 1 = "blue", 2 = "red", 3 = "purple"
color_hats = ["green", "blue", "red", "purple"]

# Lists commonly hold values of the same data type.
my_favorite_things = ["Chocolate", "beach", "mountains", "breakfast_tacos"]

# Lists can contain values with different data types.
my_favorite_things = ["Chocolate", 9, "beach", 10, "breakfast_tacos"]

# Lists can even hold other lists!
my_favorite_things = ["Chocolate", 9, ["beach", "mountains"], "breakfast_tacos"]
